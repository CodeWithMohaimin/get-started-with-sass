[**_Please note that browsers do not recognize SASS, so a compiler needs to compile it to CSS._**]

### Step 03

```text
Create a .scss file at the same root level as your index.html
file and name it index.scss This is our SASS file.
```

![sass file](./image/sass-file.png)

### Step 04

```html
Add the following code that will style your
<h1>element.</h1>
```

```css
$red-bg: red;
h1 {
  background-color: $red-bg;
}
```

### Step 05

**_Don't forget to write .css extension_**

```html
Add the following to the tag of your HTML file.
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" />

```
